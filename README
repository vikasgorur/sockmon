==========
sockmon
==========

This package contains a pair of programs that attempt to keep a TCP
connection alive indefinitely.

Dependencies
------------

This package needs the pthreads library to build.

Building
--------

$ make

This will generate the sockmon binary. The same binary can act as both
server and client.

Invocation
----------

Start the server with the desired port number. The process will not
automatically daemonize. It will also log to stdout, so you might want
to redirect it to a file.

$ ./sockmon -s -p 24000 > /home/vikas/sockmond.log &

Start any number of clients on any number of hosts with the server's
IP address (NOT the hostname) and the port number. Again, the client
does not daemonize and logs to stdout.

$ ./sockmon -c 10.1.30.21 -p 24000 > /home/vikas/sockmon.log &

Options
-------

  -c, --client=SERVER-IP     Run as client (connect to SERVER-IP)
  -p, --port=PORT            Port number to use [Mandatory]
  -s, --server               Run as server
  -t, --time=SECONDS         Time interval in seconds (default: 300) for pings
                             (client only)
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message
  -V, --version              Print program version

The time interval (-t) option controls how often the client pings the
server. The default is 5 minutes.
